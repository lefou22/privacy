    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>
  <p class="privacy-intro">This Privacy Policy explains how Arcana Insight Tarot (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the AI Tarot app.</p>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="overview">
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>The app offers reflective tarot readings enhanced by generative AI. We minimise personal data collection and rely on pseudonymized identifiers so we can operate moderation workflows while respecting your privacy.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="data">
    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect: (a) a transient reading ID we generate for each AI request, (b) a pseudonymized Firebase installation ID (hashed client identifier), (c) the structured prompt built exclusively from the cards you selected, (d) the AI-generated interpretation, (e) basic telemetry such as timestamps, language, and spread type, and (f) Firebase App Check integrity signals. Your typed or verbal question never leaves the device and is not stored on our servers.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="usage">
    <h2>3. How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>We use the pseudonymized identifiers to deliver the AI reading, detect misuse, investigate reports, improve guardrails, and maintain service reliability. Data is not sold or shared for advertising.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="aiSafety">
    <h2>4. AI Interactions and Safety</h2>
    <p>Before any prompt is sent we apply guardrails to block unsafe or policy-violating card combinations. We also moderate AI responses from Groq to comply with Google Play restricted-content rules. Firebase App Check tokens ensure requests originate from an untampered app build.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="reporting">
    <h2>5. User Reporting</h2>
    <p>When you flag an AI reading we log the reading ID, the pseudonymized installation ID, the generated prompt, the AI response, your selected reason, and any optional notes. This allows us to reproduce the issue, alert our team, and take action on the underlying model. If in-app reporting is unavailable you can email lefou0@outlook.com with the reading ID.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="retention">
    <h2>6. Retention</h2>
    <p>AI reading logs and reports are stored in pseudonymized form for as long as needed to investigate abuse, comply with legal requirements, or improve safety mechanisms. We periodically aggregate or delete records that are no longer required.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="security">
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We use HTTPS for all requests, restrict access to operational staff, rely on Firebase App Check for integrity enforcement, and monitor CloudWatch alerts to detect misuse.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="thirdParties">
    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We send sanitized prompts and metadata to Groq, our AI provider, strictly to obtain the interpretation. It does not receive your question or personal data. Firebase supplies authentication, App Check, and installation identifiers.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="privacy-section" data-section="children">
    <h2>9. Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. If we learn that we inadvertently processed data from a child we will delete it promptly.</p>
